### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub
I'm Skanda Akkihebbal Prasanna, a Roboticist by hobby and passion. As a Robotics engineer with a Master's degree from Northeastern University, I bring dedicated experience focusing on the development and seamless integration of embedded systems tailored specifically for robotics platforms.

Proficient in Linux software development, Python, C++, C, and bash scripting, I possess a solid foundation in robotics frameworks such as ROS, ROS2, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. My expertise extends to designing, implementing, and optimizing algorithms for various robotics applications. 

Skilled in sensor integrationâ€”including GPS, RTK GPS, IMU, LIDAR, RGB-D cameras, stereo cameras, and IR cameras. I am enthusiastic about leveraging these skills to address real-world challenges in robotics and autonomous systems. 

My knowledge of hardware platforms, including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, OpenCR, and NVIDIA Jetson, enables me to construct robust and scalable robotics systems. Furthermore, I have hands-on experience with simulation tools like Gazebo, CARLA, and MoveIt for testing and validation.

Passionate about exploring the forefront of robotics technology, I am particularly interested in autonomous vehicles, drones, robotic navigation, perception, planning, and manipulation systems.

Committed to continuous learning and self-improvement, I approach projects with a collaborative mindset and have a proven track record of contributing effectively to multidisciplinary teams.
